<h1 id="How-did-you-come-up-with-this-list"><a href="#How-did-you-come-up-with-this-list" class="headerlink" title="How did you come up with this list?"></a>How did you come up with this list?</h1><p>This list was difficult to compile because there are so many great horror movies. I tried to narrow it down to my personal favorites, as well as some underrated and underseen gems.</p>
<h1 id="The-Descent"><a href="#The-Descent" class="headerlink" title="The Descent"></a>The Descent</h1><p>The Descent is a 2005 British horror film written and directed by Neil Marshall. It tells the story of six women who descend into a cave system and become stranded. Forced to fight for their lives, they encounter Dennis, the only other member of their expedition who is not yet dead, and things take a turn for the worse.</p>
<p>This film is incredibly intense and claustrophobic. The characters are well-developed, and the story is paced perfectly. The ending is absolutely horrifying, and will leave you reeling.</p>
<h1 id="Saw"><a href="#Saw" class="headerlink" title="Saw"></a>Saw</h1><p>Saw is a 2004 American psychological horror film written by Leigh Whannell and James Wan, and directed by Wan. It stars Cary Elwes, Danny Glover, Monica Potter, Michael Emerson, Tobin Bell, and Leigh Whannell.</p>
<p>The story follows two strangers who wake up in a bathroom with chains at their feet and buckets over their heads, with instructions that they must kill one another or else Jigsaw (Tobin Bell), the mastermind behind the game, will kill them both. The film spawned seven sequels, making it one of the most successful horror franchises of all time.</p>
<p>Saw is an intense and mind-bending thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end. The plot is clever and unpredictable, and the cast is excellent. If you’re looking for a truly disturbing horror movie, Saw is definitely worth watching.</p>
